# Description of the project
In the hit anime Evangelion, there is a futiristic city shown which sinks into the ground when in danger. This type of futurism is intriguing and we sought to recreate the environment and vibe for our project. We want players to truly experience how  this life could be. https://www.reddit.com/r/NeonGenesisEvangelion/comments/q7erof/this_is_tokyo3_this_is_our_city_and_its_the_city/ here attached

# Instructions for use
WASD <- Movement keys
SPACE / MOUSEWHEEL UP + DOWN <- Jump
E <- Interact
C <- Save point
V <- Reload to save point
ESC <- quit

# Bunny hopping, or "bhopping"
This a technique used to increase speed and maneuverability.
It involves a sequence of jumps, performed at the point of contact with the ground, to prevent a speed penalty, paired with the player's movement and turning

Here's a basic overview of how to bhop:

1. Start Running: Begin by running forward in the game.
2. Jump: As you start moving, jump.
3. Mid-Air Movement: While in the air, slightly turn your character in the direction you want to go and strafe (move sideways) in that direction. For example, if you turn right, strafe right.
4. Timing the Jumps: As soon as you land, jump again and repeat the process â€“ turn and strafe in the same or opposite direction.
5. Rhythm and Momentum: The key to successful bhopping is maintaining a rhythm. Each jump and strafe should be smooth and timed to maintain or build speed. ( for this project "autohop" is enabled and so therefore rhythm is not as important)

# How it works
Game has a simple interactable button which causes the building animation to begin. The remainder of the game is a clone of the "bhop" mechanic from Quake / Source engine games.
The button emits a signal which begins the animation. The player movement is then utilized to complete the platforming aspect of the game.
