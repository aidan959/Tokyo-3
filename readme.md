# Description of the project
In the hit anime Evangelion, there is a futiristic city shown which sinks into the ground when in danger. This type of futurism is intriguing and we sought to recreate the environment and vibe for our project. We want players to truly experience how  this life could be. https://www.reddit.com/r/NeonGenesisEvangelion/comments/q7erof/this_is_tokyo3_this_is_our_city_and_its_the_city/ here attached

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
